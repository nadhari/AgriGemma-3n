## üåæ About AgriGemma-3n

### The Challenge We Address

Every year, crop diseases destroy approximately 20-40% of global agricultural production, translating to economic losses exceeding $220 billion. For smallholder farmers in developing regions, these losses can mean the difference between prosperity and poverty. While agricultural experts exist, their reach is limited. For instance in Sub-Saharan Africa, the ratio of extension workers to farmers can be as low as 1:1000.

Traditional computer vision approaches to crop disease diagnosis, while technically impressive, fail to bridge the knowledge gap. They can identify diseases but cannot engage in the nuanced, conversational support farmers need: understanding symptoms, explaining disease progression, recommending context-appropriate treatments, and adapting advice to local conditions.

### Our Approach

AgriGemma-3n transforms crop disease diagnosis from a classification problem into a comprehensive agricultural advisory system. Built on Gemma 3n's efficient architecture, our models combine:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Fine-tuned on a subset of 137,000 carefully curated images spanning 60 disease categories across 16 major crops
2. **Domain Expertise**: Trained on a subset 1 million question-answer pairs covering diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies
3. **Conversational Intelligence**: Capable of multi-turn discussions that mirror consultations with agricultural experts
4. **On-Device Deployment**: Optimized to run on mobile devices with limited connectivity

### Training

Using Unsloth, we implemented a comprehensive LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy:

<img width="1357" height="636" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-09 at 3 05 47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4b7b855-a427-4045-a365-31591571e800" />

```python
model = FastVisionModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    finetune_vision_layers     = True,
    finetune_language_layers   = True,
    finetune_attention_modules = True,
    finetune_mlp_modules       = True,
    r              = 32,
    lora_alpha     = 32,
    lora_dropout   = 0.05,
    bias           = "none",
    random_state   = 3407,
    target_modules = "all-linear",
)
```


This approach enables the model to learn domain-specific visual features critical for accurate diagnosis while maintaining conversational abilities.

### Dataset

<img width="563" height="450" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-09 at 4 18 48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a0a70e-1ad2-4fd8-a30f-e111b52edf82" />


We use **9000** samples of the [Crop Diseases Domain Multimodal Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06973v1)
The whole dataset contains:
- **137,000 images** spanning 60 disease categories across 16 major crops
- **1 million Q&A pairs** covering diagnosis, prevention, and treatment
- Expert-validated annotations
- Balanced distribution across crop types and diseases

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### Using Transformers

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForVision2Seq
from PIL import Image

# Load model and processor
model = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained("Nadhari/AgriGemma-3n-E2B-it")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Nadhari/AgriGemma-3n-E2B-it")

# Load and process image
image = Image.open("path/to/crop_disease_image.jpg")
prompt = "What disease is affecting this plant and how can I treat it?"

# Generate response
inputs = processor(images=image, text=prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200)
response = processor.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```
